WHAT IS THIS?!?!

It's a monster. It is a base made from https://github.com/signintech/gopdf with some of the interfaces provided by https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf. I highly advise you use one of these two libraries if you want reliable pdf generation in go. This has mostly been worked on for our own use cases, however both projects have benifited from this work.
